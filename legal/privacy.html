<p>
We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information.

<strong>“Cookies”</strong> are electronic files created by your web browser that many websites place on a visitor’s computer to store information that makes each visit to a respective site more efficient.
Our Sites may use both “session” and “persistent” cookies.
Session cookies store information about you only while you are visiting our site, and is then deleted when you leave our site.
Persistent cookies store information about you, your preferences, and information about other websites you visit, and remains on your computer or device after you leave our website.
To remove cookies, you may configure your browser to clear all cookies, or configure it to reject cookies whenever you visit a new website.
Please consult your browser’s documentation for specific instructions on removing cookies.

No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 2 years.
</p>
<p>
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process.
However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure, nor can we guarantee that our third parties are 100% secure.
Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Sites is at your own risk.
You should only access the services within a secure environment.

<p id="section10"><strong>10.&nbsp; CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></p>
<p>
Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected.
No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized.
As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.
If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.
</p>
