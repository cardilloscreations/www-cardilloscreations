    This information is primarily needed on our websites to maintain security and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.

<p id="section02"><strong>2.&nbsp; HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>
<p><strong>In Short:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>We process your information for purposes based on legitimate business interests, the fulfillment of our contract with you, compliance with our legal obligations, and/or your consent.</p>
<p>
    This software does not collect any information that can identify you personally. Our other Software, Sites, and Services are likely to have different policies and should also be read and understood before using them. You should also review the Privacy Policy of any Third Party services listed below.

<p id="section03"><strong>3.&nbsp; WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?</strong></p>
<p><strong>In Short:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> We only share personal information with your consent, to comply with laws, to protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations.</p>
<p>
    This software does not collect any information that can identify you personally. However, if you share it with us through other means, in general, we may process or share data based on the following legal basis:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Consent:</strong> We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to use your personal information in a specific purpose.</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> We may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance of a Contract:</strong> Where we have entered into a contract with you, we may process your personal information to fulfill the terms of our contract.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).</li>
        <li><strong>Vital Interests:</strong> We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Vendors, Consultants and Other Third-Party Service Providers.</strong> We may share your data with third party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. Examples include: payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service and marketing efforts. We may allow selected third parties to use tracking technology on the Sites, which will enable them to collect data about how you interact with the Sites over time. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content and better understand online activity. Unless described in this Policy, we do not share, sell, rent or trade any of your information with third parties for their promotional purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
</ul>

<br />

<p id="section04"><strong>4.&nbsp; WHO WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH?</strong></p>
<p><strong>In Short:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> We only share information with third parties that we trust and support our business needs.</p>
<p>
    This application does not collect, share, or disclose your information, but it does use 3rd party frameworks or libaries.
    These providers may not actually collect any data but they are being disclosed because we use their services so they have the potential to collect your information.
    We have categorized each party so that you may easily understand the purpose of our use and the potential for data collection and processing.
    We are not in direct control of these third party providers so you should review their privacy policies carefully as well.

    This application does not use cookies, advertising IDs, or similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. However, our websites may, so please read their respective privacy policy before using them.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>“Cookies”</strong> are electronic files created by your web browser that many websites place on a visitor’s computer to store information that makes each visit to a respective site more efficient.
    Our Sites may use both “session” and “persistent” cookies.
    Session cookies store information about you only while you are visiting our site, and is then deleted when you leave our site.
    Persistent cookies store information about you, your preferences, and information about other websites you visit, and remains on your computer or device after you leave our website.
    To remove cookies, you may configure your browser to clear all cookies, or configure it to reject cookies whenever you visit a new website.
    Please consult your browser’s documentation for specific instructions on removing cookies.

<p id="section06"><strong>6.&nbsp; HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>
<p><strong>In Short:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless otherwise required by law.</p>
<p>
    We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements).
    No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 2 years.
</p>
<p>
    When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
</p>

<br />

<p id="section07"><strong>7.&nbsp; HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></p>
<p><strong>In Short:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>
<p>
    We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process.
    However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure, nor can we guarantee that our third parties are 100% secure.
    Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Sites is at your own risk.
    You should only access the services within a secure environment.
</p>

<p><strong>In Short:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from children under 18 years of age.</p>
<p>
    While some of our content may appeal to a younger audience, we do not knowingly solicit data from children under 18 years of age.
    Although this application does not directly collect any data, it does use <a href="#section04">third party frameworks</a> that have the potential to collect data. However, this application does not allow minors to provide consent and any frameworks being used are configured according to consent selection.
    If you become aware of any data that we have collected from children under age 18, please contact us immediately.
</p>

<p id="section09"><strong>9.&nbsp; WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></p>

    These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability.

    Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal.

<p id="section10"><strong>10.&nbsp; CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></p>
<p>
    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected.
    No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized.
    As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.
    If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<br />

<p id="section11"><strong>11.&nbsp; DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></p>
<p><strong>In Short:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.</p>
<p>
    California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year.
    If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.
